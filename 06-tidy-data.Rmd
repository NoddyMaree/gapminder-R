### Tidy data

Data can be organized many ways. While there may be times that call for other organizational schemes, this is the standard and generally-best way to organize data:

1. Each variable forms a column
1. Each observation forms a row
1. Each observational type forms a table

What exactly constitutes a variable can be difficult to define out of context, but as a general rule, if observations are measured in different units, they should be in different columns, and if they are measured in the same units, there is a good chance they should be in the same column.

An example will clarify. [Here is a dummy dataset](https://github.com/michaellevy/gapminder-R/raw/gh-pages/data/wide_eg.csv). Is this data in tidy format? Why not -- which of the three principles does it not satisfy?

```{r}
eg <- read.csv('data/wide_eg.csv')
eg
```

It looks like we've got four individuals, each subjected to three conditions -- a control and two treatments. Each observation here is a person in a treatment (we don't know what the measured value is), so each row should be defined by a person-treatment; that is, we should have 12 rows with four columns: subject, sex, condition, and the measured value. 

#### `gather()` 

We can transform the data tidy form quite easily with the `gather` function from the `tidyr` package. Of course, if you haven't yet installed `tidyr`, you'll need to do that using `install.packages(tidyr)`, and we need to load it.

Arguments to `gather` include the data.frame you're gathering, which columns to gather, and names for two columns in the new data.frame: the key and the value. The key will consist of the old names of gathered columns, and the value will consist of the entries in those columns. The order of arguments is data.frame, key, value, columns-to-gather:

```{r tidyr}
library(tidyr)
gather(eg, condition, value, control, treatment1, treatment2)
```

You can also tell `gather` which columns not to gather -- these are the "ID variables"; that is, they identify the unit of analysis on each row.

```{r tidyr 2}
gather(eg, condition, value, -subject, -sex)
```

> You could argue that it is or is not in tidy form, because you could see the two outcomes as different variables or two ways of measuring the same variable. For our purposes, consider them two ways of measuring the same variable and `gather` the data.frame so that there is only one measurement of RSD on each row.

### Joins

The third tidy data maxim states that each observation type gets its own table. The idea of multiple tables within a dataset will be familiar to anyone who has worked with a relational database but may seem foreign to those who have not. 

The idea is this: Suppose we conduct a behavioral experiment that puts individuals in groups, and we measure both individual- and group-level variables. We should have a table for the individual-level variables and a separate table for the group-level variables. Then, should we need to merge them, we can do so using the `join` functions of `dplyr`. 

The join functions are nicely illustrated in RStudio's [Data wrangling cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf). Each function takes two data.frames and, optionally, the name(s) of columns on which to match. If no column names are provided, the functions match on all shared column names.

The different join functions control what happens to rows that exist in one table but not the other. 

- `left_join` keeps all the entries that are present in the left (first) table and excludes any that are only in the right table. 
- `right_join` keeps all the entries that are present in the right table and excludes any that are only in the left table.
- `inner_join` keeps only the entries that are present in both tables. `inner_join` is the only function that guarantees you won't generate any missing entries.
- `full_join` keeps all of the entries in both tables, regardless of whether or not they appear in the other table.

We will practice on our continents data.frame from module 2 and the gapminder data.frame. Note how these are tidy data: We have observations at the level of continent and at the level of country, so they go in different tables. The continent column in the gapminder data.frame allows us to link them now. If continents data.frame isn't in your Environment, load it and recall what it consists of:

```{r}
load('data/continents.RDA')
continents
```

We can join the two data.frames using any of the `dplyr` functions. We will pass the results to `str` to avoid printing more than we can read, and to get more high-level information on the resulting data.frames.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
left_join(gapminder, continents) %>%
    str()

right_join(gapminder, continents) %>% 
    str()
```

These operations produce slightly different results, either 1704 or 1705 observations. Can you figure out why? Antarctica contains no countries so doesn't appear in the gapminder data.frame. When we use `left_join` it gets filtered from the results, but when we use `right_join` it appears, with missing values for all of the country-level variables:

```{r}
right_join(gapminder, continents) %>% 
    filter(continent == "Antarctica")
```
