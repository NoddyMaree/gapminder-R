title: R for reproducible scientific analysis
---

Introduction to R for non-programmers using gapminder data.

The goal of this lesson is to teach novice R users to effeciently write
scripts to manage, analyze, visualize, and writeup data. The lessons take
seriously the idea that motivation comes before detailed understaind, so
some details are omitted for the sake of introducing more, and more-powerful
tools, including ggplot, dplyr, tidyr, and knitr. Note that this workshop 
focuses on data management and analysis but does not teach statistical analysis.

A variety of third party packages are used throughout this workshop. These
are not necessarily the best, nor are they comprehensive, but they are 
packages we find useful, and have been chosen primarily for their 
usability.
