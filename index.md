title: R for reproducible scientific analysis
---

Introduction to R for non-programmers using gapminder data.

The goal of these lessons is to teach novice R users to efficiently write
scripts to manage data, conduct analyses, produce visualizations, and 
write up the results in a reproducible manner. The lessons take
seriously the idea that motivation comes before detailed understanding, so the focus is on learning powerful tools: ggplot, dplyr, tidyr, and knitr. The capstone project at the end of the workshop asks learners to integrate many of the concepts from earlier lessons.
